                    <p> Dynami Systems is a company started by a group of young entrepreneurs striving to make a difference. Santa Monica is a city with numerous landmarks, with thousands of tourists pouring each year. Bike Sharing is a way to make Santa Monica have a greener environment, while reducing the amount of traffic in the city.
                    </p>

                    <p>  At the beginning of the summer of 2014, twenty-eight students were brought in to be apart of the Santa Monica Youth Technology Program. From there, the students were split up into four groups that would each go on to start their own civic oriented business. When our group(Team C)was faced with the task of deciding which business idea we wanted to pursue, we all thought it would be best to choose an idea that we were all passionate about. From there, our members discovered that we were all interested in an easier and more sustainable way to get around the city we had all grown up in. Originally we thought that our best shot at succeeding in the Santa Monica Youth Tech program was to start our own bike sharing program in Santa Monica. That idea was quickly shot down however due to the fact that in order to obtain all the necessary resources we would need a substantial amount of money that we did not have. Despite being shut down, our group knew that transportation was what we were passionate about pursuing. From there we went back to the drawing board and discovered there was a way that we could get involved in bike sharing that did not involve quite as much money. We would no longer be attempting to start our own bike sharing program, but rather to help already existing companies manage theirs. This idea allowed the members of our team to still work on a project that they were passionate about while also keeping our business plan realistic. That is how Dynami Systems was created.

                    <p> Dynami Systems is a service that not only keeps track of bike inventory for a bikesharing buisness, but also lets the consumer know where the soon to be bike stations will be around the city. </p>
