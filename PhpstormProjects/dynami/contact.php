                            <p>As the C.A.O of Dynami Systems my job is not always to work hands on with the technology, but rather to make sure everyone around me is working as efficiently as possible. I do this daily by talking to my members about what they are doing, what they have done, and what their goals are by the end of the day. By asking these questions I make sure that everybody realizes the tight schedule we are on and what we must do to reach our goals as a company.</p>
